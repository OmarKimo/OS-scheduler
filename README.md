# OS-scheduler
It's a mini project in my third year at Computer department in Faculty of Engineering Cairo University.

It's an implementation for an Operating systems scheduler which produce schedules of certai process based on some scheduling alogorithms which is:
1. Non-Preemptive Highest Priority First. (HPF)
2. First Come First Served. (FCFS)
3. Round Robin with fixed time quantum. (RR)
4. Preemptive Shortest Remaining Time Next. (SRTN)

The application is divided into two modules:
* Process generator: generates the processes to be scheduled.
* Scheduler: produces the schedules based on the chosen algorithm and demonstrates these schedules by visual graphs.
